//Sometimes your application needs to support multiple algorithms or behaviors that can vary at runtime. 
//Here is how most of does that, a giant if else block
// This violates the open/close principle.Because our code isnâ€™t open for extension. Its open for modification.
// The strategy pattern solves this by encapsulating each algorithm in its own class and making them interchangeable.
